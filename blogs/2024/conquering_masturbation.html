          <p>It is interesting to note that the same scripture that condemns porn in Matthew 5:27-30, also condemns masturbation. This is because masturbation involves impure thoughts. The eyes and the hands are connected and so often, porn addicts are also addicted to masturbation.</p>
          <p>It is a work of the flesh and your conscience convicts you every time you do it, because it is a sin. It is uncleanness / lasciviousness (Gal.5:19). </p>

          <h2>Why christians masturbate</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h3>Exposure to pornographic materials</h3>
              <p>Porn is fuel for masturbation. Most Christians recognize sex before marriage as sin and when their sexual passions are stirred up through porn, because they do not want to commit fornication; masturbation becomes a way of escape for them, to satisfy their lust.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Lust</h3>
              <p> The spirit of Lust releases a burning desire for things that God forbids. It makes you start desiring things that you know are bad. It will make you despise the things you ought to value (Example - Esau and his birth right - Heb.12:16-17). Lust is a fleshly passion, but can graduate to a demonic spirit, that makes you masturbate until you can no longer resist it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Witchcraft (Gal.5:20)</h3>
              <p>This is the spirit behind porn and masturbation. It is what strippers and porn stars do. They tease (manipulate and seduce) to awaken sexual passions. This is why people often feel helpless when the urge to watch porn or masturbate comes upon them, because it’s like another spirit takes over them. Witchcraft is rebellion (1Sam.15:23).</p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Consequences of Masturbation</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>It will lower your self-esteem and cause you to lack confidence.</li>
            <li>Feeling guilty, sad and depressed becomes a daily routine.</li>
            <li>Fatigue - feeling tired all the time.</li>
            <li>Infertility - Low sperm count for men and frustration during sex because of premature ejaculation.</li>
            <li>It's a work of the flesh that can lead to hell, except you repent - Col.3:5-6.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>How to defeat masturbation</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h3>Get restless</h3>
              <p>You cannot change what you can tolerate (Gen.27:40). As long as you are comfortable with masturbation, you will remain a slave to it. Nobody can do this for you. You must decide that you want a change. Stop condemning yourself, believe in God's love for you and prove His power in your life (Phil. 2:13).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Engage the Holy Spirit</h3>
              <p>The pleasure you think you are getting from masturbation is simply demonic deception. It's a lie. God calls it death (Rom. 6:23). True pleasure can only be found through fellowship with the Holy Spirit. Any time you feel the urge to masturbate, deliberately pray in tongues until the urge disappears. The urge is the devil's invitation to death (James 1:14-15). Kill it by the power of the Holy Spirit - Rom.8:13. Reckon yourself dead to sin and refuse to be enslaved by it - Rom. 6:6-7.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Starve your flesh</h3>
              <p>Masturbation needs a lot of sexual images to survive, so you have to deliberately starve it. Clear out from your life anything that will awaken lust, like social media, novels, secular music, movies etc. (Rom.13:14, 1Thess.4:2-5).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Fill Your Mind With God's Word</h3>
              <p>Psalm 119:111 - The basic reason many Christians lack power to resist sexual sin is that, they have not been studying and meditating on God's word. The word of God is food and strength to overcome the flesh, as well as salvation from the power of sin (Matt.4:4, James 1:21)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Speak To Your Mountain</h3>
              <p>Mark 11:23 - The believer in Christ is not fighting to obtain victory over sin, but fighting to maintain his victory in Christ. We are victorious already (1John 5:4). Do not let the devil deceive you with lying symptoms. Jesus has triumphed over sin, the flesh and the devil (Heb.2:14-15, Rom.6:6-14, Gal.5:24). Simply command the "urge and feelings" to stop; command the spirit of masturbation to loosen its hold on you. Declare God's Word in faith and you will have what you say.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Discern spirits</h3>
              <p>The urge to masturbate usually comes at certain times (e.g. - early in the morning, late at night etc.), or at certain places (e.g. - in the bathroom, bedroom etc.) or when you are in certain moods (e.g. - when anxious, tense, sad, moody etc.) One has to be extra cautious at such times. Bath quickly, spend more time around people than alone, do push-ups (exercises) to distract your mind, cast your cares on the Lord and spend more time praising God instead of worrying. Practice Philippians 4:6-9 daily. Stay strong and boldly maintain your freedom in Christ Jesus.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
