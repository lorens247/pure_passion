            "Pay close attention, my child, to your Father's wise words and never forget your mother's instructions. For their insight will bring you success ... <br>
            <strong>When peer pressure compels you to go with the crowd and sinners invite you to join in, you must simply say, 'No!'</strong> When the gang says – 'We're going to steal and kill and get away with it' . . . my son, refuse to go with them and stay far away from them”– <strong>Proverbs 1:8-15</strong> TPT.
          </p> -->

          <h2>Sex is not evil</h2>
          <p>It's only evil when done 
            with someone you are not married to. Sex is an act of covenant between a man and a woman who are legally married.</p>
          
          <h2>Sex is all emcompassing</h2>
          <p>It involves kissing, necking, smooching, cuddling, intercourse etc. The word “kiss” means “to kindle.” It gives the idea of awakening sexual passions. Hence it cannot be excluded from the act of sex.</p>
          <p>Therefore, every form of physical contact should be avoided before marriage. Your first kiss should be on your wedding day, after you have been pronounced “husband and wife” by the Clergy - <strong>1Cor.6:19-20</strong></p>

          <h2>Sex is not love</h2>
          <p>But Hollywood teaches us otherwise. Every movie is spiced up with a sex scene and specially packaged to excite the sexual passions of viewers. A guy meets a girl and the next thing you know, they are taking off their clothes to have sex and they claim they are in love.</p>
          <p>That is complete rubbish. If sex is love, then prostitutes would be the most loved people in the world - <strong>1 John 4:17, 5:1-3</strong>.</p>

          <h2>Sex Does Not Make You Mature Or “hot”</h2>
          <p>The fact that you have had sex does not mean that you are now a “man”, “mature”, or a “hot babe”. It is actually proof that you are still thinking like a child. Maturity is the ability to control your emotions (feelings) and sexual passions until you are married (<strong>Eccles. 10:16-17, Gal. 5:16-23</strong>).</p>

          <h2>Sex is not a sport</h2>
          <p>You do not win any prizes for your skills or performance. The American porn industry is largely responsible for this view about sex. They show many sex positions and acts that are very unrealistic.</p>

          <p>Many of the scenes are done under the influence of drugs and alcohol and they give the impression that doing anything “less” means that you are still an amateur. Hence many young people have fears about not being “good enough” for their spouses in bed or not being “professional enough”.</p>

          <p>Sex should never be reduced to just another sporting event. It is an act of love shared between a man and his wife. The beauty of sex is not in the many styles or performance but in the love being shared between the married couple involved.</p>

          <h2>Dangers of premarital sex</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h3>Premarital sex doesn't make you a man/woman (Prov.7:10-23)</h3>
              <p>It rather reduces you to a piece of bread - it makes you feel worthless. It kills your self-esteem and gives you an inferiority complex - <strong>Prov.6:26</strong></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Premarital sex robs you of your purity</h3>
              <p>You lose your consciousness of God (the privilege to see, hear and fellowship with God intimately). Only the pure in heart can see God - <strong>Matt. 5:8</strong></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>It bring guilt and shame</h3>
              <p>Which kills your joy and passion for the things of God. Hence David cried in <strong>Psalm 51:11-12</strong>, “...take not thy Holy Spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation”</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Premarital sex will destroy your destiny</h3>
              <p>Joseph understood this, hence he fled from Potiphar's wife (<strong>Gen.39:7-13</strong>). It can also cause HIV, barrenness, cancer and other diseases.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>It will invite demons into your life</h3>
              <p>It will make you miserable and ultimately send you to hell.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p><span>Note:</span> Condoms and pills will not protect you from the judgement of God. Do not throw your future away. Abstain from pre-marital sex. But if you have already had sex, simply repent and cry out to God like King David. See <strong>Psalm 51</strong>.</p>
