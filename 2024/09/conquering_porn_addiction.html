            "Pay close attention, my child, to your Father's wise words and never forget your mother's instructions. For their insight will bring you success ... <br>
            <strong>When peer pressure compels you to go with the crowd and sinners invite you to join in, you must simply say, 'No!'</strong> When the gang says – 'We're going to steal and kill and get away with it' . . . my son, refuse to go with them and stay far away from them”– <strong>Proverbs 1:8-15</strong> TPT.

          <p>Pornography has become like a deadly pandemic in our day. Every Christian needs to be on guard and in order to stay safe, practice <span class="bible-passage">Job 31:1 - “I made a covenant with my eyes not to look lustfully at a woman."</span></p>

          <h2>Dangers of porn</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h3>It causes men to view women as mere sex objects</h3>
              <p>Porn will make you see a woman as an object (thing) to be used, rather than a person to be loved (adored). Porn addicts very easily abuse women physically and sexually.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>It creates guilt that is hard to shake off</h3>
              <p>Porn makes one feel guilty, ashamed 
                and disgusted with himself. It often leads 
                to one having an inferiority complex, lack 
                of confidence, loss of memory, depression 
                and even suicidal tendencies.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>It encourages one to live a secret double life</h3>
              <p>Porn, like most sexual sins, is mostly done in secret. It pushes one to become secluded and secretive; often lying and scheming to avoid getting caught. This has broken many marriages and cost others their jobs and reputations.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>It forms memories that hinder pure relationships</h3>
              <p>Porn will make it difficult to think purely of the opposite sex. Some people can't stay without sex, because porn has messed up their minds.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>It grieves the Holy Spirit</h3>
              <p>Porn quenches the Spirit and opens up one's life to demons; destroys destinies and can ultimately send one to hell, if he/she does not repent - <b>Galatians 5:19-21</b>.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Why people engage in porn</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h3>Curiosity</h3>
              <p>The average Christian's mind is very curious and hence when we see posts on Facebook like, "naked pictures of 'so and so' celebrity found", our curious minds often want to check to be sure if it is true. This is how many Christians get addicted.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Boredom</h3>
              <p>We often say the idle mind is the devil's workshop. Sadly, many Christians are very idle. Nothing awakens the flesh like idleness and boredom (Exo. 32:1-8).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Depression</h3>
              <p>Some Christians are daily faced with the reality of their failures - at work, business, marriage etc. When depression sets in, the mind begins to crave excitement and porn becomes a way to “get high” and escape reality.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Breaking free from porn</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h3>Repent</h3>
              <p>Resolve to turn away from porn. One proof that you have truly repented is that you will hate the sin you once loved. You can hate porn by focusing on God’s love and judgement (Rom.11:22). Declare boldly: I hate porn and I refuse to be a slave to it in Jesus Name.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Starve your flesh (Rom.13:14)</h3>
              <p>Deliberately put off your phone or anything that awakens the urge for porn. You have to be very serious about turning away from porn (1Corinthians 9:27).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Get drunk in the Spirit</h3>
              <p>By praying hard and long in tongues (1Cor. 14:4) and by meditating on God's Word (Psalm 119:11). Nobody gets drunk by taking sips, so you need to drink a lot from God's Word and Spirit to stay full of the Holy Spirit and keep your flesh subdued - Ephesians 5:18.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Resist the devil (James 4:7)</h3>
              <p>There are spirits behind porn addiction. You must confront and conquer them. You have authority in Christ to bind the activities of the devil - Luke 10:19. Command the spirits behind porn to loose their hold on you and be gone from you in Jesus Name (Matt.18:18). </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Be accountable</h3>
              <li>Talk to your Pastor. The sin you expose, becomes easier to resist. Also request for prayers andcounselling (Prov. 28:13).
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
