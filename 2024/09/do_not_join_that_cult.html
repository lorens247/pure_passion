          <p>Have strange young menorladies approached you, offering you gifts, power, 'connections', or promises of protection? Or you’ve been attacked by these strangers? This may just be the work of a secret cult trying to initiate you.</p>

          <p>You may be hurting and thirsty for revenge, or at least, hungry for peacefrom the constant bullying, and for that reason, you may want to join a group that will make you a “hard man”, untouchable on campus or in your area. But my friend, there is a way that seems right to a man, but the end of it is the way of death (Prov. 16:25). God Himself advises us on this issue, saying, </p>

          <p class="bible-passage">“My child, when sinners tempt you, don't give in. Suppose they say, "Come on; let's find someone to kill! Let's attack some innocent people for the fun of it! ...Come and join us, and we'll all share what we steal." My child, don't go with people like that. Stay away from them. They can't wait to do something bad. They're always ready to kill. It does no good to spread a net when the bird you want to catch is watching, but people like that are setting a trap for themselves, a trap in which they will die. Robbery always claims the life of the robber---this is what happens to anyone who lives by violence.” - Proverbs 1:10-19 (GNB)</p>

          <p>Your freedom from oppression is not in the hands of any cult, it is in the hands of God alone. God has planned a lot of great things for your future, but the moment you allow even a drop of your blood to enter into any oath, you have sold your future to the devil, and when he has finished using you, he will waste your life like he has done to so many others who have died as a result of cult fights.</p>

          <p>You will also discover that, because of the blood oath you have taken, you will see certain problems repeat itself in your life: either you are always failing in your exams, or your results are always incomplete, or you always fall ill, or trouble always seems to find you some way, some how.</p>

          <p>If you have already made this mistake, do not be afraid, there is still a way out. You can choose to accept The Lord Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour, and renounce that cult and all your associations with it. It may not be easy at first, but if you call to your saviour, the Lord Jesus, He will deliver you and make you a testimony for others.</p>

          <p>He will show you the true brotherhood to join – the brotherhood of the redeemed, where you will find true love and peace, where you will not fear rumours or the sound of gunshots.</p>

          <p>No cult member is truly your friend. All they want is more men and women to use and rule over. Cry to the Lord today, and He will deliver you from your enemies who are too strong for you (Psalm 18:17). He will also wash your blood-stained hands with His own blood and give you a brand-new life.</p>
