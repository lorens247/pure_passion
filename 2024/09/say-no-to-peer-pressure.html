            "Pay close attention, my child, to your Father's wise words and never forget your mother's instructions. For their insight will bring you success ... <br>
            <strong>When peer pressure compels you to go with the crowd and sinners invite you to join in, you must simply say, 'No!'</strong> When the gang says – 'We're going to steal and kill and get away with it' . . . my son, refuse to go with them and stay far away from them”– <strong>Proverbs 1:8-15</strong> TPT.
          </p>
          <h2>1. Reject inferiority complex</h2>
          <p>
            Inferiority complex will make one engage in vices like drug abuse, cultism, alcohol, sex, rituals etc, without considering the consequences, just so they are not perceived as fools by their friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sadly, in a bid to be seen as “wise”, “smart”, or “a hard guy/babe”, some youths are presently battling with depression (suicidal thoughts), locked up in prison, or being treated in a Psychiatric hospital somewhere, but that does not have to be your story. GOD has something better for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            The simple way to build your self esteem is to get born again and begin a new (superior) life in Christ Jesus. Also, be filled with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit will give you the boldness you need to say ‘No!’ to peer pressure.
          </p>
          <p>
            See <strong>Luke 11:13</strong>, <strong>Acts 1:8</strong> and <strong>2Tim.1:</strong>.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Discover your vision</h2>
          <p>A vision is God showing you the assignment and future He has planned for you - <strong>Acts 26:19</strong>. A vision will show you who you truly are, what you ought to be doing and where you ought to be going in life (<strong>Prov. 29:18</strong>). </p>
          <p>
            Most people who bow to peer pressure and begin to take drugs, smoke, steal, have illicit sex, do rituals etc., usually do not have a vision for their lives; that is, they cannot see a bright future and are plagued with a terrible sense of hopelessness
          </p>
          <p>
            A vision from God will restore hope in your heart concerning the future and strengthen you to resist evil. (<strong>Heb. 12:1-3</strong>). Example: Joseph's vision in <strong>Gen. 37:5-10</strong> helped him avoid sinning with Potiphar's wife. People who lack vision can easily be influenced to do what they are not supposed to do.
          </p>
          <p>
            A Godly Vision will help you discern the things to avoid; that is, things that will not help you achieve your destiny. Simply spend time with God in prayer and Bible study and ask Him to show you the plans He has for your life and He will.
          </p>
          <p>
            See <strong>Jer. 29:11-13</strong> MSG.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Stay focused</h2>
          <p>
            Most people usually start out having great dreams. No child is born for example, desiring to be a gambler or prostitute, but a broken focus gets them there. Today, social media has distracted many youths and addicted them to a “false life.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Other distractions are porn, video games, sex etc. As a student, your relationship with God and future career should be your greatest priority.
          </p>
          <p class="subtitle">Three Keys to staying focused:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Mind The Company You Keep:</strong> You will never advance beyond the friends you keep (<b>Prov.13:20</b>). Your friends influence your vision, passion and destiny. Make friends with people who are intelligent, hardworking and godly <b>1Cor.15:33-34</b> CEV – “Don't fool yourselves. Bad friends will destroy you. Be sensible and stop sinning...”
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Study God's Word Daily:</strong> The Word of God in your heart is the strength you need to stay focused and defeat sin - <b>Psalm 119:9-11</b> GW – “How can a young person keep his life pure? He can do it by holding on to your word...”
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pray Hard And Long In Tongues:</strong> This will keep you conscious of God and His will for your life. – <b>1Cor. 14:4</b> TPT – “The one who speaks in tongues advances his own spiritual progress ...”
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>4. Put your trust in God, not man</h2>
          <p>
            Your friends can fail you, but God never fails. Today, we see young people resort to sinful activities like; internet fraud (yahoo), gambling (betting), cultism, rituals, exam malpractice etc, because their friends have convinced them that, that is how to “make it in life.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The truth is, any success you achieve by these means is actually failure before God. It is not true that school is a scam. There are no shortcuts to success; you cannot rely on man's wisdom, you just have to trust God, work hard and follow God’s instructions.
          </p>
          <p>
            No man, jazz (charm) or demon has the power to make you successful in life. Internet fraud, rituals, betting etc., will fail you, but faith in God never fails.
          </p>
          <p class="bible-passage">
            <b>Proverbs 3:5-7</b> MSG – “Trust GOD from the bottom of your heart . . . Don't assume that you know it all. Run to GOD! Run from evil!”
